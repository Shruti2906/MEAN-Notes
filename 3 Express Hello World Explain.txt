========================
Explaination : 


const express = require('express')
	-importing the express js library/module into out application.


const app = express()
	-we are initializing the app using te express
	-using the app we are configuring the route of "GET" and path is "/get".
	-whenever there is request for this endpoint /get ->
	response we'll get "hello WOrld"


const port = 3000
	-port is a variable which has given value 3000.


app.get('/get', (req, res) => {
	  res.send('Hello World!')
	})

		-We are calling "get" method of object "app".
			for post it would be app.post(), app.delete(), app.put() etc.

		-First parameter is url (i.e '/get')
		
		-(req, res)=>{} is callback mechanism.
		-we could use any name like request, response, or a, b etc.
		-req will contain request captured.
		-res will contain response.
		-here we are sending string 'hello world'.


app.listen(port, () => {
	  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
	})

		-we are starting the app at port(whatever value given to port)
		-when we run app.js it will start at this port  and print on console 'Example app listening on port 3000'
